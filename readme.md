## Curriculum Mapping Tool

Pilot web based application to allow practitioners to browse and edit FE Resources.

The aim is to map FE Resources to the Curriculum, Subject Areas and Qualification Levels.

The Resources are contained in an Elastic Search repository (not included in this Github repo).

This web application has been rapidly put together as a pilot, so don't expect miracles.

It is using Laravel 4, Cartalyst Sentry, Highcharts and Kube CSS. And handcrafted code.
